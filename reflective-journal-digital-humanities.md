# Reflective Journal on Digital Humanities Topics

## Introduction

While being involved in this module, I have learned a lot of concepts that highlight how technology impacts society, cultures, and knowledge. Every week, I have gained new knowledge about how technology works, how it affects people for their benefit as well as harm, and how we should use it for good. In this assignment, I would like to reflect on what I learned in this module in terms of our readings, videos, and class sessions, as well as how it has impacted my perspective on technology.

## Week 1: Anatomy of an AI System, and a Brief History of the Web

In week one, we learned about AI systems and how they work. This has opened my eyes as I now realize that AI was never just a technology that “just figures things out.” Learning about AI systems and understanding how an AI system looks has taught me that AI is comprised of data, code, and human choice (Burrell, 2016). This has reminded me that AI systems are not completely objective. I now understand that it’s human choice, such as picking which data to use and how an algorithm should look, that impacts what the AI output will be. Week one has also opened my eyes to how the history of the Internet has been established. Learning about how ARPANET, Tim Berners-Lee, and Vint Cerf were able to create the web has taught me that it took a very long period of time for the web to be developed (Castells, 2001). I was surprised to learn that it was a cable in Ireland, known as the Valentia transatlantic cable, that gave “access to the worldwide Internet.” This has taught me that it’s not all about technology, but also about people.

## Week 2 & 3 – Transformations, HTML, and Open Access

Weeks 2 and 3 focused on how information moves from paper to screen, and we started to learn coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Seeing how a simple webpage came together showed that a webpage was not only for showing information but also a concept of structure and design (Mozilla Foundation, 2023). This assignment enabled me to see how information can be structured and how small changes in coding can make a huge impact on how it can be used by those wishing to access it.  

During this time, we were also introduced to Open Access, and we watched “The Internet’s Own Boy,” a documentary on Aaron Swartz, a true hero who stood for open access to all knowledge. I started to think about how knowledge itself has paywalls around it that limit who can acquire it. The readings and Guerilla Open Access Manifesto gave me plenty to think about when it came to fairness and moral implications of access to knowledge (Eve, 2014). I also started to think about how I, as a tech user, needed to use technology morally for my own knowledge acquisition. I also learned further about web design when I was assembling all of my projects and started to think about how they needed to be accessible to as many different types of users as possible.

## Week 4 – Digital Integrity, Social Media, and Surveillance

Week four has been about digital integrity and responsibility. Reading “A Contract for the Web” by Tim Berners-Lee in 2019 and “books related to the Filter Bubble” by Eli Pariser in 2011 has opened my eyes to how our worldview is being shaped by social media sites and search engines. I also learned that many of our sources are shaped by algorithms that are beyond our control.  

We also read “books related to Surveillance Capitalism” by Shoshana Zuboff in 2019, which explained how our data creates sources of income for search engines and companies. Looking back on how I use technology, I can now see that every like, comment, and click changes our worldview from search engines and social media sites. A TED Talk video by Carole Cadwalladr reinforced in class how important it is to think twice before putting any information online. I learned this week that to be a good citizen of this world of technology, it is important to be a critical thinker. I also started offering ways I personally will change how I use technology in my life.

## Week 5 – Project Workshop: Digital Education and Wellbeing

The fifth week consisted of a practical task related to digital education and wellbeing. Here, we critically analyzed a preprint article related to “design thinking for digital wellbeing” by van der Velden and Robinson in 2021. This experience has opened my eyes to how important design is. Websites that are user-friendly are stress-reducing and contribute to effective learning. Another important point is that when there is too much screen use, a lack of wellbeing follows; therefore, a design point related to balance would be pertinent.  

I now realize that digital literacy encompasses more than technical skills. Digital literacy encompasses an understanding of how technology impacts individuals’ feelings and wellbeing. I learned from class experience that design thinking has immense value in group work. This experience from Week Five has enabled me to develop a hands-on understanding of how design, ethics, and theories are interconnected in practical projects related to technologies.

## Week 7: Archives, Knowledge Keeping, and Open Access

Week seven involved reading about archives and their role in maintaining knowledge and history. I learned that archives play a vital role in maintaining culture, but it has to be done in a manner that ensures access is protected (Smith, 2018). We also spoke of projects in various GLAM industries, using technology to make archives accessible. I pondered how not all archives are Open Access. Some archives are delicate and wide access could cause harm.  

I analyzed projects such as those of the Freedmen’s Bureau and Smithsonian, as well as how technology has enabled history to be accessed by many readers, yet it needs to be done with care. I also considered metadata, understanding that it aids in searching archives stored digitally. Using technology to provide access preserves archives while giving readers a treasure of knowledge and showing how things are interconnected in history.

## Week 8: Internet of Things and Internet of Sounds

Week eight brought readings about Internet of Things and Internet of Sounds. I learned how devices connected to the internet are used to make interactive experiences. Projects using Raspberry Pi and museum exhibitions show how history and culture can come to life (Mesch, 2022).  

The project for Internet of Sounds showed that oral history sounds and environmental sounds are also digitized. History has now become a fun experience rather than boring. From reading on this topic, I discovered how technology has given a voice to stories that were lost. This also showed how I, as a technology user, can communicate history in a way that is not misrepresented. I also considered how I can use this technology in learning institutions to offer a fun way of lecturing history.

## Week 9 – Open AI, ChatGPT, and Algorithmic Ethics

During week nine, I analyzed AI technology, including ChatGPT and other large language models. Reading articles like “stochastic parrots” from 2021 by Bender et al. and other articles by Safiya Noble from 2018 showed issues of bias and unfairness in AI. I analyzed ELIZA, a chatbot from 1960, and learned AI has a long history of trying to make machines understand humans (Weizenbaum, 1966). Articles by Joy Buolamwini on unfairness in AI reminded me that technology can result in inequalities unless closely watched (Buolamwini, 2016).

## Week 10: Vision, Immersion, and New Technologies

Week ten focused on Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Extended Reality, as well as ethical considerations for AI artworks. The London Charter gave rules to help use digital technology in cultural heritage responsibly (Denard, 2009). Reading about Virtual and Extended Reality opened my eyes to how technology can revolutionize learning about history and cultures.  

However, issues like prizes for AI artworks made me ponder fairness and human creativity. I now realize that technology, despite its revolutionary nature, has issues linked to fairness, accuracy, and ethics. This week also linked concepts from previous weeks. Technology, for example, in relation to Open Access, enables knowledge access but requires ethical analysis at every step.

## Overall Reflection

Reflecting back on every week, I learned that technology always affects users. They begin to think in different ways, with different knowledge, and different actions. I also learned that technology has a dual nature. On one hand, it has positive uses, such as distributing knowledge and conserving culture. On the other hand, it poses questions about diversity and misuse of data.  

This module has taught me to think critically about all online activities and tools. Being digitally aware is more than just knowing software or websites. A new domain of ethical, accessible, and societal implications of technology use has emerged. I also realize I possess an online persona that I, as a responsible person, can manage. This course has opened my eyes to the potential of immersive technology in VR, IoT, and AI, but using it wisely. Concepts from this course are linked; for instance, the history of web technology relates to AI, archives, and immersive tech. This course has taught me how to apply class theories to real life and understand the bigger picture of technology, and that I have a role as a responsible user.
